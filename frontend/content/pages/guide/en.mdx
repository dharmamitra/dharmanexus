The evolution of Buddhist scriptures and the formation of the various Buddhist canons are complex processes that often stretch over a long period of time and involve numerous aspects of the societies in which they take place. Understanding these two related processes is crucial to our study of the history of Buddhism in general and of Buddhist ideas in particular. It is also instrumental in gaining an appreciation for the impact of social and cultural phenomena on intellectual and religio-philosophical developments and vice versa. It will necessarily mean at times shedding light on various issues related to these two processes, both on the macro and micro levels, such as the existence of intellectual networks, various stages in the evolution of a specific scripture, intertextuality between various scriptures, the linkage between treatises and scriptures, and the impact of various social and political aspects of society on both the evolution of scriptures and the formation of canons.

The first step towards a better understanding of the history of composition of individual texts, on the one hand, and the emergence of entire corpora of Buddhist works, on the other, is to locate in the various texts and textual corpora (approximate) textual matches and to study them from various angles. These textual matches may be cases of either acknowledged citations or “borrowed” textual passages with no attribution. Until not very long ago, such matches were searched for manually, but with the advent of computer technology, coupled with the ongoing digitization of Buddhist texts, faster and more accurate methods have been developed. DharmaNexus is a powerful tool aimed at facilitating the study of the evolution of Buddhist scriptures and the formation of the various Buddhist canons by exploiting artificial neural networks in order to locate (approximate) textual matches.

## Databases

### Chinese

The textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the [Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association](https://www.cbeta.org/) (CBETA).

The minimum length for a match has been set to six characters. However, five-character matches are occasionally also detected due to our policy of “approximate matches” rather than exact ones. Matches consisting to a large degree of frequent fixed terms have been filtered out from the results.

### Pāli

The Pāli textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka Buddhavasse 2500: World Tipiṭaka Edition in Roman Script. Edited and published by The M.L. Maniratana Bunnag Dhamma Society Fund, 2005. Based on the digital edition of the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana published by the [Vipassana Research Institute](https://tipitaka.org/) (VRI), with corrections and proofreading by the Dhamma Society.

The Sutta, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma texts have been sourced from [Bilara](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data), SuttaCentral’s JSON-based segmented texts, which have been extensively tested to ensure integrity and correctness.

The remaining commentary texts of the Aṭṭhakathā, Tikā, and Anya have been sourced from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana as published by the Vipassana Research Institute.

### Sanskrit

The Sanskrit textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the Göttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages ([GRETIL](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html), Georg-August-Universität Göttingen), the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon ([DSBC](https://www.dsbcproject.org/), University of the West), some files from [SuttaCentral](https://www.suttacentral.net/) (SC), and a couple of files obtained from individual researchers.

Due to the huge amount of material, some texts from the original databases have been omitted (cumulative pāda indexes and duplicate texts from the same source). Moreover, there has been no attempt by DharmaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos, introducing identical conventions, and the like). Some minor changes have, nonetheless, been made for the sake of standardization. In order to make the matching process feasible, some markup information of the original files has been neglected.

The Buddhist Sanskrit files are structured in accordance with the organizational scheme of the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, whereas “Buddhist Scriptures” corresponds to the Kangyur and “Buddhist Non-Scriptures” to the Tengyur. For the non-Buddhist material taken over from GRETIL, the data structure has been slightly altered. The folders 4_rellit/buddh and 6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/ have been removed and their content divided under “Buddhist Scriptures” and “Buddhist Non-Scriptures.” Moreover, a numbering scheme was introduced to simplify the access to the different GRETIL categories. For example, \"GV01\" represents GRETIL Veda 1.

For the calculation of the Sanskrit matches and for the global search function, a stemming algorithm has been used. The stemming algorithm is accessible as a [standalone application](https://Dharmanexus.net/sanskrit-tools).

The minimum possible length for a match has been set to 25 characters.

### Tibetan

The Tibetan textual corpora used in DharmaNexus were obtained from various sources, including [Asian Classics Input Projects](https://asianclassics.org/) (ACIP) for the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, [Buddhist Digital Resource Center](https://www.tbrc.org/) (BDRC) for the rNying ma bka’ ma, and Karma Delek for the rNying ma rgyud ’bum. As a result the digital texts might occasionally differ in their conventions. Moreover, due to the huge amount of material, there has been no attempt by DharmaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos, introducing identical conventions, and the like). Occasionally, however, some minor changes to the texts were made for technical reasons (e.g. standardization of transliterations or formats). Since our algorithms search for approximate (and not exact) matches, we believe that in most cases variants resulting from typos, or from different orthographies and the like, should not pose major problems in detecting textual matches.

Regarding matches involving the Prajñāpāramitā Section of the bKa’ ’gyur, due to the extremely repetitive nature of this corpus within itself, all matches among files of this section have been excluded from the results for the sake of a better performance.

The minimum match length is 14 syllables. Shorter matches are also displayed if the match in either the Inquiry or Hit text is a verse line consisting of a precise length of 7, 9, or 11 syllables. The verse lines are only detected if they are placed between a pair of either a single or double stroke (shad) at the beginning and a double stroke at the end. Matches that are longer than 13 syllables but consist to a large degree of stop words, grammatical particles, and the like have been filtered out from the results.

## Usage

DharmaNexus will publish the textual matches of the various languages and textual corpora gradually, as work progresses. It will also keep on improving the algorithms so as to improve the results of both the monolingual textual matches and their respective translingual alignments. In general, the biggest challenge has been to set “gold standards” in order to get the best results, on the one hand, and avoid “noise,” on the other. While striving to optimize the default “gold standards,” DharmaNexus understands that such standards may fluctuate depending on the text under inquiry, research questions, and personal interests, so it allows the user to manually set several of the parameters. Moreover, in order to facilitate analyses from different perspectives, several view options are possible.

The textual corpora used in DharmaNexus were obtained from various institutions (for details, see the individual languages). Due to the huge amount of material, there has been no attempt by DharmaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos and the like). Occasionally, however, some minor changes to the texts were made for technical reasons (e.g. standardization of transliterations or formats). As our algorithms search for approximate (and not exact) matches, we believe that in most cases variants resulting from typos, or from different orthographies and the like, should not pose major problems in detecting textual matches.

### Enter the Database

In order to enter the database, select the language of your choice by either clicking on the respective symbol or selecting it from the top menu bar, under “Database.”

### Submit an Inquiry

In order to submit an inquiry select a text from the dropdown list by using their respective catalogue numbers (for details, see the guide to the individual languages). Once the matches have been generated (Text View), you can view them by either scrolling down and up or by selecting the passage you are interested in by selecting the respective folio, facsimile, sutta or segment number from the dropdown list. You may alternatively select a text from the sidebar (opens upon clicking on the menu symbol <ExploreOutlinedIcon fontSize="small" /> situated on the left side of the menu bar), which offers an overview of the available texts according to thematic sections of various kinds.

### Global Text Search

The Global Text Search offers a search by a text passage. Upon typing in a text passage (max. length 150 characters), a list with the pertinent hits will be displayed. A click on any of the results will display the full text in the Text View mode. The total number of possible search results is limited to 200 items.

### Filter Options

- **Similarity Score:** Uses string edit distance as a base for calculation. These can vary between 0 and 100%. The value 100 means a perfect match, while a lower value indicates less similarity. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Minimum Match Length:** Filters by minimum length of the matches based on the match’s number of characters, excluding punctuation signs. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Exclude Collections:** Does not display the matches found in the excluded collections (or sections).
- **Exclude Files:** Does not display the matches found in the excluded files.
- **Limit to Collections:** Displays the matches found only in the selected collections (or sections).
- **Limit to Files:** Displays the matches found only in the selected files.

### View options (under construction)

- **Text View**: Upon selecting a file, the entire Inquiry Text with the passages for which matches are found is shown. The presence of matches in the Inquiry Text is indicated by colours. To view the matches use the scrollbar, to go back to the beginning of the Inquiry Text click the <KeyboardDoubleArrowUpIcon fontSize="small" /> symbol, to display the Inquiry Text in a new tab, click the <LaunchIcon fontSize="small" /> symbol. Upon selecting (by clicking) any of the coloured positions, the matches found in various Hit Texts for that position will be displayed in a new column. Whenever multilingual alignment (Sanskrit—Tibetan) is available for the Inquiry Text, the multilingual match would be displayed first, followed by the various monolingual matches found in other texts. (An option for disabling the multilingual match display is available in the filter.) By clicking on any of these matches the respective Hit Text will be displayed in yet another column, with the match in question highlighted. All matches with the Inquiry Text found in the displayed Hit Text are coloured. To display the Hit Text in a new tab, click the <LaunchIcon fontSize="small" /> symbol .
- **Table View**: Displays a table of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. The results can be sorted in three different ways: (1) by their position in the Inquiry Text, (2) by their position in the Hit Text(s), and (3) by the length of the match in the Hit Text.
- **Numbers View**: Displays a table with the segment numbers of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. This view mode is only available for Pāli and Chinese texts, where the segment numbers represent the PTS and Taisho numbers, respectively.
- **Graph View**: Displays various graphs visualizing the (approximate) matches found for the Inquiry Text. The pie graph displays the distribution of the (approximate) matches according to the collection’s sections. The histogram shows the distribution of the top files that have matches with the Inquiry Text based on the accumulated length of the approximate matches. A maximum of 50 Hit Texts are shown.
