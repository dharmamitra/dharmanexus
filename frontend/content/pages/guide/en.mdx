BuddhaNexus will publish the textual matches of the various languages and textual corpora gradually, as work progresses. It will also keep on improving the algorithms so as to improve the results of both the monolingual textual matches and their respective translingual alignments. For the upload of new data, major improvements of existing functions, and introduction of new functions, see [News](./news). In general, the biggest challenge has been to set “gold standards” in order to get the best results, on the one hand, and avoid “noise,” on the other. While striving to optimize the default “gold standards,” BuddhaNexus understands that such standards may fluctuate depending on the text under inquiry, research questions, and personal interests, so it allows the user to manually set several of the parameters. Moreover, in order to facilitate analyses from different perspectives, several view options are possible.

The textual corpora used in BuddhaNexus were obtained from various institutions (for details, see the [Introduction page](./introduction)). Due to the huge amount of material, there has been no attempt by BuddhaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos and the like). Occasionally, however, some minor changes to the texts were made for technical reasons (e.g. standardization of transliterations or formats). As our algorithms search for approximate (and not exact) matches, we believe that in most cases variants resulting from typos, or from different orthographies and the like, should not pose major problems in detecting textual matches.

## Databases

### Chinese

The textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the [Chinese Buddhist Electronic Text Association](https://www.cbeta.org/) (CBETA).

The minimum length for a match has been set to six characters. However, five-character matches are occasionally also detected due to our policy of “approximate matches” rather than exact ones. Matches consisting to a large degree of frequent fixed terms have been filtered out from the results.

### Pāli

The Pāli textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the Mahāsaṅgīti Tipiṭaka Buddhavasse 2500: World Tipiṭaka Edition in Roman Script. Edited and published by The M.L. Maniratana Bunnag Dhamma Society Fund, 2005. Based on the digital edition of the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana published by the [Vipassana Research Institute](https://tipitaka.org/) (VRI), with corrections and proofreading by the Dhamma Society.

The Sutta, Vinaya, and Abhidhamma texts have been sourced from [Bilara](https://github.com/suttacentral/bilara-data), SuttaCentral’s JSON-based segmented texts, which have been extensively tested to ensure integrity and correctness.

The remaining commentary texts of the Aṭṭhakathā, Tikā, and Anya have been sourced from the Chaṭṭha Saṅgāyana as published by the Vipassana Research Institute.

### Sanskrit

The Sanskrit textual corpus used in DharmaNexus was obtained from the Göttingen Register of Electronic Texts in Indian Languages ([GRETIL](http://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html), Georg-August-Universität Göttingen), the Digital Sanskrit Buddhist Canon ([DSBC](https://www.dsbcproject.org/), University of the West), some files from [SuttaCentral](https://www.suttacentral.net/) (SC), and a couple of files obtained from individual researchers.

Due to the huge amount of material, some texts from the original databases have been omitted (cumulative pāda indexes and duplicate texts from the same source). Moreover, there has been no attempt by DharmaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos, introducing identical conventions, and the like). Some minor changes have, nonetheless, been made for the sake of standardization. In order to make the matching process feasible, some markup information of the original files has been neglected.

The Buddhist Sanskrit files are structured in accordance with the organizational scheme of the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, whereas “Buddhist Scriptures” corresponds to the Kangyur and “Buddhist Non-Scriptures” to the Tengyur. For the non-Buddhist material taken over from GRETIL, the data structure has been slightly altered. The folders 4_rellit/buddh and 6_sastra/3_phil/buddh/ have been removed and their content divided under “Buddhist Scriptures” and “Buddhist Non-Scriptures.” Moreover, a numbering scheme was introduced to simplify the access to the different GRETIL categories. For example, \"GV01\" represents GRETIL Veda 1.

For the calculation of the Sanskrit matches and for the global search function, a stemming algorithm has been used. The stemming algorithm is accessible as a [standalone application](https://Dharmanexus.net/sanskrit-tools).

The minimum possible length for a match has been set to 25 characters.

### Tibetan

The Tibetan textual corpora used in DharmaNexus were obtained from various sources, including [Asian Classics Input Projects](https://asianclassics.org/) (ACIP) for the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, [Buddhist Digital Resource Center](https://www.tbrc.org/) (BDRC) for the rNying ma bka’ ma, and Karma Delek for the rNying ma rgyud ’bum. As a result the digital texts might occasionally differ in their conventions. Moreover, due to the huge amount of material, there has been no attempt by DharmaNexus to improve the quality of the texts (e.g. removing typos, introducing identical conventions, and the like). Occasionally, however, some minor changes to the texts were made for technical reasons (e.g. standardization of transliterations or formats). Since our algorithms search for approximate (and not exact) matches, we believe that in most cases variants resulting from typos, or from different orthographies and the like, should not pose major problems in detecting textual matches.

Regarding matches involving the Prajñāpāramitā Section of the bKa’ ’gyur, due to the extremely repetitive nature of this corpus within itself, all matches among files of this section have been excluded from the results for the sake of a better performance.

The minimum match length is 14 syllables. Shorter matches are also displayed if the match in either the Inquiry or Hit text is a verse line consisting of a precise length of 7, 9, or 11 syllables. The verse lines are only detected if they are placed between a pair of either a single or double stroke (shad) at the beginning and a double stroke at the end. Matches that are longer than 13 syllables but consist to a large degree of stop words, grammatical particles, and the like have been filtered out from the results.

### Enter the Database

In order to enter the database, select the language of your choice by either clicking on the respective symbol on the homepage or selecting it from the top menu bar, under “Database.”

### Submit an Inquiry

In order to submit an inquiry select a text from the menu, which offers an overview of the available texts according to thematic sections of various kinds, or use the search field to find a specific text. Once the matches have been generated, you can view them by either scrolling down and up or by selecting the passage you are interested in by selecting the respective folio, facsimile, sutta or segment number from the dropdown list in the settings menu on the right (under Options). You can change texts by clicking the "Change Text" button on the right side above the text, which opens a sidebar on the left, which again offers an overview of the available texts according to thematic sections.

### Global Text Search

The Global Text Search offers a search by a text passage. Upon typing in a text passage (max. length 150 characters), a list with the pertinent hits will be displayed. A click on any of the results will display the full text in the Text View mode. The total number of possible search results is limited to 1000 items. It is possible to apply a filter to these results to limit the results to a specific language, or to include or exclude text(s).

### Filter Options

- **Similarity Score:** Uses string edit distance as a base for calculation. These can vary between 0 and 100%. The value 100 means a perfect match, while a lower value indicates less similarity. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Minimum character/syllable matches length:** Filters by minimum length of the matches based on the match’s number of characters, excluding punctuation signs. The default value varies from one language to another.
- **Exclude Sources:** Does not display the matches found in the excluded text(s).
- **Incude Sources:** Displays the matches found only in the selected text(s).

### View options

- **Text View**: Upon selecting a text, the entire Inquiry Text with the passages for which matches are found is shown. The presence of matches in the Inquiry Text is indicated by colours. To view the matches use the scrollbar or select a passage by selecting the respective folio, facsimile, sutta or segment number from the dropdown list in the settings menu on the right (under Options). Clicking on any of the coloured positions will show the matches found in various Hit Texts for that position in a new column. By clicking on any of these matches the respective Hit Text will be displayed in yet another column, with the match in question highlighted. All matches with the Inquiry Text found in the displayed Hit Text are coloured. To display the Hit Text in a new tab, click the number of the respective text in the last selected match in the middle column.
- **Table View**: Displays a table of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. The results can be sorted in four different ways: (1) by their position in the Inquiry Text, (2) by their position in the Hit Text(s), (3) by the length of the match in the Inquiry Text, and (4) by the length of the match in the Hit Text.
- **Numbers View**: Displays a table with the segment numbers of the matches found for the current Inquiry Text. This view mode is only available for Pāli and Chinese texts, where the segment numbers represent the PTS and Taisho numbers, respectively.
  <<<<<<< HEAD
- # **Graph View**: Displays various graphs visualizing the (approximate) matches found for the Inquiry Text. The pie graph displays the distribution of the (approximate) matches according to the collection’s sections. The histogram shows the distribution of the top files that have matches with the Inquiry Text based on the accumulated length of the approximate matches. A maximum of 50 Hit Texts are shown.
- **Graph View**: Displays various graphs visualizing the (approximate) matches found for the Inquiry Text. The pie graph displays the distribution of the (approximate) matches according to the various text collections. The distribution chart shows the distribution of the top texts that have matches with the Inquiry Text based on the accumulated length of the approximate matches. A maximum of 50 Hit Texts are shown.
